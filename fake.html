        <h1>What is Qadiyaniyat?</h1><hr>
<p>
    The "Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam" (called by Muslims everywhere as "Qadianism") was established, in 1889 by the founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani (1835 - 1908) in a small Punjabi village of India. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani's family were in the service of the British colonial powers and, to his dying days, Mirza Ghulam openly declared his allegiance to the British imperialism.In fact, the culmination of his service to foreign power was his declaration that resistance to oppressors (Jihad) -- as ordained in the Holy Quran by God -- had become unIslamic! Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani's life was laden with contradictory and anti-Islamic claims.<br>
    From 1864 to 1868, upon his father's wishes, Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani worked as a clerk in Sialkot, where he would come into contact with Christian missionaries with whom he frequently engaged in debate. After 1868, he returned to Qadian, as per his father's wishes, where he was entrusted to look after some estate affairs. During all this time, Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani was known as a social recluse because he would spend most of his time in seclusion studying religious books and praying in the local mosque. As time passed, he began to engage more with the Christian missionaries, particularly in defending Islam against their criticism.<br>
    In 1880, he declared himself to be only a Muslim writer; in 1885, he announced he was a revivalist (Mujaddid); in 1891, he claimed to be the Promised Mehdi and the Promised Messiah; and in 1901, he pronounced himself a Prophet of God! Facing an open and strong opposition by Muslim Scholars and religious leaders for this blasphemous declaration and other teachings which belittled Jesus Christ(pbuh) and contradicted the Quranic revelations, he also announced that he was the second and improved coming of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) with authority to reinterpret the Holy Quran at his pleasure! Not happy with mere prophethood, in 1904, he declared himself the Krishna (the Hindu Lord). Obviously, like an unethical modern-day politician, he was trying to appeal to all uneducated segments of the public in India !<br>

    Fortunately, the Almighty Allah(SWT), time and time again, exposed Mirza Ghulam Qadiani's falsehood through his own statements and so-called prophecies. Even many of his own family members were aware of his treachery and openly opposed his anti-Islamic teachings. Mirza Ghulam Qadiani finally died by intervention of the Almighty Allah and as the result of religious prayer challenges (Mubahala), in 1908. <br>


    Since the death of Mirza Ghulam Qadiani, his heirs -- the leaders of the Qadiani organization ("Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam") -- have been extremely busy trying to clean up his image. Backed by seemingly unlimited support they receive from their anti-Muslim allies, they have been promoting falsehood and deception through the media. They have even resorted to removing some of most controversial writings of Qadiani leadership -- which had become a source of embarrassment to them -- from circulation. Their partial English translation of their original text has been heavily edited to exclude all controversial and anti-Islamic sayings of their cult leaders. Obviously, they themselves realize the true nature of their "Ahmadiyya Mission".<br>



    The goal of the "Ahmadiyya Mission" is, and has always been, to confuse uninformed Muslims, divide the Ummah, prevent resistance to oppressors (Jihad), and provide an alternative to non-Muslims who find the message of Islam appealing. Quite cunningly, they do so by using Islamic terminology and teachings, and hiding the controversial writings of their founders. Today, only the most learned Muslims are able to attend one of their functions and realize that their brand of Islam is a form of Kufr (disbelief). Even when their leaders mention the Kalima (I bear witness there is only one God and Muhammad is his messenger), they are referring to their founder who proclaimed himself to be (God forbid) the second improved coming of the Prophet Muhammad(ﷺ) and not to the true Prophet(ﷺ) of Allah(SWT).<br>


    Muslim brethren everywhere should not be confused by Qadiani leadership's superficial use of Islamic concepts to promote their cult. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad(ﷺ) and the four Khalifah also faced such false prophets. Of particular interest is the claim by an Arab, named Musailama, to prophethood, during the latter part of the life of the Prophet(ﷺ). Although he simply claimed co-prophethood with the Prophet Muhammad(ﷺ) of Arabia and did not belie any other teaching of the Holy Quran, he and all of his mislead followers were declared out of the fold of Islam, by righteous believers. Under the leadership of Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddique(RA) and with the unanimous consensus of all the companions of the Prophet Muhammad(ﷺ), a victorious war was waged against Musailama for using Islamic concepts and claiming prophethood. This should indeed be sufficient evidence to declare the Qadianis as non-Muslims.<br>

    In 1974, after an exhaustive examination of all the evidence presented for and against the Qadianis, the Muslim World League (Rabita Alame Islami) -- which represents all religious scholars from every Muslim country of the world -- passed an unanimous resolution declaring the Qadiani Movement and its leadership out of the fold of Islam. Indeed, "Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam" is a man-made organization with no divine authority or guidance.<br>
    <h1>Difference between Muslim and Qadiani/ Ahmadi</h1>
<hr>
It is the universal decision of all Scholars across globe that Qadianis who themselves called Ahmadiyya are NOT Muslims.They are Murtad, Zindeeq and Kaafir.<br>

Murtad: A person born to a Muslim parent who later rejects Islam is called a murtad fitri, and a person who converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a Murtad.<br>

Kaafir : Kafir is the one who do kufr. Kufr means the act of knowing the truth and then outwardly rejecting it.<br>
Zindeeq : Zindeeq is a person who acknowledges the Nubuwwat of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and accepts the Shariah ( Sailent features like Salah, Fasting, Hajj) of islam, but at the same time adheres to beliefs which are unanimously branded as kufr in the Shariah..
According to the above definition the term Zindeeq will apply to all people who proclaims themselves to be muslim while at the same time prescribing to kufr beliefs. The Majority of the baatil sects fall under this category.

<br>
<h1>The following are some of the difference between Muslim and Qadianis (Ahmadiyyat):</h1>





..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) is based on the belief that Mirza was an improved second reincarnation of Hazrat Muhammad(ﷺ).<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) rejects the concept of absolute Finality of Prophethood in Hazrat Muhammad(ﷺ), as confirmed in Quran, Hadith, Sunnah of the Holy Prophet(ﷺ), Tradition of Companions, the writings of Muslim Scholars and personalities, and concensus of the entire Ummah for almost 1500 years.<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) maintains that Mirza Ghulam Qadiani was a Prophet (nabi and rasul) of God.<br>
Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) rejects the concept of completion of the revelations of Allah(SWT) in the Holy Quran.<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) holds that Mirza Ghulam Qadiani's revelations (Books) were on the same level as all prior revelations (Quran, Bible, Torah). In their view, simply following Quran and Sunnah, as Muslims have done since the beginning of Islam, is not a basis for living a righteous life and gaining the pleasure of the Creator. Interestingly, the Qadiani leadership has refused to allow a translation of these books, so that everyone may become familiar with the irrational teachings and contradictory claims of the founder of their organization.<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) rejects authentic Hadith based on Mirza's alleged revelations and teaches his personal interpretation of the Holy Quran. Qadiani (Ahmadiyya) leadership has forged several unauthentic translations of the Holy Quran to try to confuse and mislead uninformed individuals.<br>

..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) teaches that Jesus(pbuh) had been crucified, but did not die from his injuries. Instead, it advocates the view that Jesus(pbuh) recovered from his injuries, escaped to Kashmir (India), where he lived for another 86 years, and is buried there.<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) maintains that Mirza Ghulam Qadiani was "the promised Messiah". The Qadianis (Ahmadis) reject the advent of Jesus Christ(pbuh), son of Mary, as the Messiah, just before the Day of Judgment.<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) claims Mirza's Mosque at Qadian (India) to be Masjid-ul-Aqsa.
Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) holds two cities in India (Qadian) and Pakistan (Rabwah) as holy as Mekkah and Madinah. Qadianis (Ahmadiyya) are supposed to perform Hajj by attending their annual congregation, instead of visiting Mekkah.<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) teaches that Mirza Ghulam Qadiani was also the promised Mahdi (guided one).<br>
..Qadianism (Ahmadiyyat) teaches that Mirza Ghulam Qadiani was also the expected Hindu lord, Krishna.<br>

    <h1>Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani's false claims</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Below are the highlights of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani's false Claims<br>

      In 1880, he claimed that he is “Mulhim minallah”<br>
      In 1882, he claimed that He is Mujjaddid/ Mamoor minallah / Nazeer<br>

      In 1894, he claimed that he is Messiah and Mahdi<br>
      In 1899, He claimed that he is Zilli Prophet (Helper of Prophet)
      And Finally in 1901 he claimed that he is a Prophet.<br>
      Journey from Islam (submission to Allah) to Kufr (Disbelief)
      Lets see Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani in twelve different ways.<br>
      Just an average Sunni Muslim<br>
      Superior to the Great Muslims<br>
    
      A Disciple Prophet
      The Promised Mehdi
      The Promised Messiah
      Reincarnation of Muhammad
      An Apostate and New Prophet
      The Lord of Hindus
      Incarnation of All Prophets
      The Son of God
      The Christian God
      God Like<br>
       
       
      Just an average Sunni Muslim<br>
      
      In his childhood and youth, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani was taught the principles of the Sunni School of thought. Mirza Ghulam's writings during this period adhered to the authentic Islamic teachings. Particularly, he believed in the Finality of Prophethood and the role of Jesus (pbuh), as the promised Messiah. The writings of this period are the ones that the Qadianis put forth in trying to claim that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani was a Muslim and did not deviate from Islam.<br>
      
      Here are some of his writings from this period:
      "The Quran does not sanction the advent of any Prophet after the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) whether he is a new one or old one. All the knowledge that a Prophet possesses is taught by the angel Gabriel and the door of Gabriel's descent to impact the revelations of prophethood is closed for ever. How can a Prophet come now without having access to the revelations of Prophethood." (Izalat-ul-Auham, Page 761)
      <br>
       
      Superior to the Great Muslims
      <br>
      During this phase of his life, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani claimed to be superior to the Companions and descendants of the Prophet (ﷺ) . When he fell short and was not able to support his lofty claims, he resorted to attacking the character of these great individuals. Here are some of his writings from this period:
      
      "Now leave your quarrels regarding the old Khilafat. A living Ali is among you. Why should you look for a dead Ali?" (Al-Hakam, Vol. 4, Nov 10, 1900)
      "They accuse me of having placed myself above Hasan and Husain. I tell them again that it is really so, and that God will prove it very soon." (Ijaz-ul-Masiah)
      "Hundreds of Husains I have in my collar." (Al-Hukum, Jun 16, 1904)
      <br>
       
      A Disciple Prophet<br>
      
      At this phase, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani commenced planting the seed of his Kufr by claiming to be in communication with God and a "partial prophet".
      <br>
       
      Here are some of his writings from this period !
      <br>
      "There is no doubt that this humble self has come to this Ummah as a Muhaddis (one who speaks to God) who in other sense is likely a prophet,though not a full fledged prophet, nevertheless, he is a partial Prophet and one,who rejects him, incurs the chastisement of hell to certain extent." (Touzeh-ul- Maram, Page 18)
      "At first I thought I had no similarities with Christ who was a Prophet and one of the most favorites of God, and if there were any signs of the grace of God manifested in my favor, I used to consider them as a token of partial favor; but later on, God's revelations began to pour upon me like rain, and this brought a change in my beliefs and I was given the appellation of Prophet but it was a Prophet in one sense and disciple Prophet in another sense." (Haqiqat-ul- Wahi, Page 149-150)
      Obviously, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani was in total dark regarding the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad(ﷺ) dealing with the Finality of Prophethood. Specifically, he must have not known the following two authentic Hadith at the time he made such claims:
      You (Hazrat Ali) are related to me as Aaron was related to Moses(pbuh). But no Apostle will come after me. (Bukhari, Muslim Musnad recorded a similar hadith ending in 'Behold there is no prophethood after me.') If ever there arose a person from among my people who would hold communion with God, it would be none else but 'Umar bin Khattab. (Bukhari , Muslim, Tirmidhi)
      If ever there arose a person from among my people who would hold communion with God, it would be none else but 'Umar bin Khattab. (Bukhari , Muslim, Tirmidhi)<br>
       
       
      The Promised Mehdi<br>
      
      The next logical step for Mirza was to raise himself to become the Promised Mehdi. Since he was counting on the ignorance of masses, he was not worried about the fact that he did not fulfill any of Islamic prophecies regarding Mehdi.<br>
      
      Here are some of his writings from this period:<br>
      
      "Mirza Ghulam Ahmad also claimed to be the promised Mehdi, not the Mehdi who was engaged himself in conquest and bloodshed but the reasoning Mehdi who would vanquish his opponents by arguments. He called himself Promised Mehdi and superior to numerous prophets." (Me'ar-ul-Akhyar, Page 11)<br>
      
      Obviously, Mirza Ghulam was unsuccessful to even vanquish his opponents by argument and discussion. He was rebuffed and ridiculed easily by both Muslim and Christian Scholars alike. His only accomplishment was to show that he could find some simple minded individuals who would follow his false claims.<br>
       
       
      The Promised Messiah<br>
      Not quite happy at being just Mehdi, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani decided to give himself a quiet promotion by declaring himself to be the Messiah foretold by all religions of the world! Once more, since the naive and impressionable villagers he was initially dealing with were uninformed of the prophecies regarding the Messiah, he was not concerned with being exposed.<br>
      
      To explain the fact that he -- unlike the foretold Messiah -- did not descend from the heavens in the company of angels, he invented a fairy-tale regarding Jesus Christ(pbuh): in this tale Jesus(pbuh) is crucified, but does not die nor is raised to God to fulfill his future mission as the promised Messiah. Instead, he recovers from his injuries and escapes to Kashmir (India) where he lives for eighty six more years, does not preach Islam, and does not leave any traces of his living there!<br>
      
      Here are some of his writings from this period:<br>
      
      "Give up all mention of the Son of Mary: Ghulam Ahmad is far greater." (Dafiul- Bala" Page 20)
      "It is my claim that I am that Christ about whom all the sacred scriptures have prophecied that his advent will take place in the last days of the world." (Tuhfai- Gooladia, Page 195i)
      "I swear by That God who controls my life that He sent me and He had named me a Prophet and He has called me the Promised Christ and has established my claims with great signs that number above three lakhs. [3 million miracles!]" (Tatimma-i-Haqiqat-ul-Qahi, Page 68)
      "So you are blessed. The Messiah has come to you. God, the Powerful has placed His hand on him and bestowed His eloquent speech upon him.... You are blessed. The Mehdi of the time had come to you with abundant riches and endless wealth.... You people, I am the Messiah of Muhammad's line and I am Ahmad al-Mahdi." (Khutba Ilhamia, Page 60, 61, 98)
      <br>
       
      Reincarnation of Muhammad (ﷺ)
      <br>
      As a Muslim, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani knew too well that the advent of a new Prophet is impossible. However, dealing with people who did not understand the original Arabic text and were unaware of the extensive body of Hadith clearly opposing any form of prophethood, Mirza Ghulam resorted to deceptive translation of the Holy Quran to claim to be a superior reincarnation of the Prophet Muhammad !<br>
      
      Here are some of his writings from this period:
      <br>
      
      "I am that same Prophet , the very Incarnation of the "Seal of Prophets" and twenty years back in the Book Baraheen-i-Ahmadiah, I was called by God by the names of Muhammad and Ahmad and was declared by God Himself to bethe very Prophet in fresh and blood." (Eik Ghalati-ka-Izala, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)
      "Muhammad has again come among us. His new position is an improvement on his earlier visitation. If any man wishes to see Muhammad, akmal (more competent), then he should see Ghulam Ahmad, in Qadian." (Al-Badr, Oct 5,1906; Written by a poet and published by Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)
      "It is a fact that Muhammad(pbuh) worked only three thousand miracles... My Miracles exceed one million in numbers." (Ijaze-e-Ahmadi, Page 79; Tadhkira tul Shahadatain, Page 41)
      "It is possible for a man to attain a spiritual position higher than any other man; if any man wishes, he can rise even above Muhammad(pbuh)." (Daily Al-Fadl, Jul 17. 1992, Mirza Basheer al-Din Mahmud Qadiani)<br>
       
       
      An Apostate and New Prophet<br>
      
      By now, everyone should have noticed the pattern of Mirza Ghulam Qadiani. He was indeed a person with an ego that needed continuous feeding and boosting. He had elevated himself to be better than Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) , whom weare told was the greatest man to ever live. Yet, he was not happy! He was still partially bound by the Quran and Hadith of the Prophe t(ﷺ) and, to break free, he needed to attain full Prophethood!<br>
      
      Here are some of his writings from this period:<br>
      "The true God is He who sent His messenger to Qadiani." (Dafi-ul-Bala, Page11)<br>
      
      "How can I discard God's revelations which has been coming to me for the last twenty-three years. I believe in this sacred revelation as I believe in the revelations before me." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 15)
      <br>
      "We claim to be Rasul (Messenger) and Nabi (Prophet)." (Al-Badr, March 5, 1908, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)<br>
      
      "I have been given what no other man in the universe has been given." (Tadhkira, Page 658)<br>
      
      "Lo! We have sent unto you a messsenger as witness among you, as we once sent a messenger unto Pharaoh." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 101)<br>
      
      "I swear by God in whose hand lies my existence and say that it is He who has reputed me and called me a Prophet and the Messiah." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Appendix, Page 68, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)
      "He (Mirza Ghulam) is a Prophet of God and the like of every prophet." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 79, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)
       
      <br>
      The Lord of Hindus
      <br>
      Since Mirza Ghulam Qadiani lived in India, it was an astute and calculated move on his part to reach out to the Hindus of the society, by calling himself the Hindu Lord, Korishna. This also amounted to a promotion, since a Lord is better than a simple Prophet!<br>
      Here is his claim from this period:<br>
      
      "Just as the Aryan people are awaiting the coming of Shri Krishna. I am the same Krishna, and this claim is not only mine but God repeatedly revealed to
      me that I am the same Krishna, the King of the Aryans to come in the last days of the World." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 45, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)
      <br>
       
      Incarnation of All Prophets<br>
      
      Mirza Ghulam had claimed to be a prophet, however his character was incompatable with that of all prior Prophets(pbut) and he was not capable of
      performing miracles. We have already seen hints of his attempt at boosting his claim by making false accusations against prior Prophets (pbuh); at this stages, he tries to make himself the beneficiary of all the good characters of all the Prophets.
      <br>
      Here is his claim from this period:v
      
      "Whatever was given individually to each Prophet has been collectively given to me." (Nuzul-e-Masih, Page 99)
      "One into whom God entered is in the garb of the prophets." (Anjam Atham,Page 53)
      "I am the Messiah of the time and I am Moses on whom God conferred His speech. I am Muhammad and Ahmad, the selected one." (Taryaq-ul-Qulub, Page 3)<br>
      "My Lord has established the likeness between Adam and myself: Allah made me Adam and gave me all that was given to the Father of mankind." (Khutbae-Ilhamia, Page 253-254)<br>
      "There was no Prophet whose name was not given to me, as I was told in the"Baraheen Ahmadiah that I am Adam, I am Noah, I am Issac, I am Jacob, I amIsmail, I am Moses, I am Abraham, I am Jesus, and I am Muhammad. In the capacity of a Prophet Incarnate." (Tatimma-Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 84, Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)<br>
       
       
      The Son of God
      <br>
      You will be surprised to see how far Mirza was willing to take his claims! We allow his own writings, alleged by him to be revelations from God, to speak for themselves: Below references are from his own books
      <br>
      "You are unto me as my son." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 86; Tadhkira, Page 526, 642)
      "Listen to Me, My Son" (Al-Bushra, Vol 1, Page 49)<br>
      "God has preferred you above everything else." (Tadhkira, Page 469, 579, 638)<br>
      "You are from me and I am from you: your appearance is my appearance." (Tadhkira, Page 650, 700)<br>
      "Listen to Me, My son; Thou art from My water and they (other people) from dust..." "Christ and I (Mirza Ghulam) are in a position wherein we can be metaphorically termed as sons of God." (Dafi-ul-Bala, Page 6; Haqiqat-ul-Wahi, Page 86; Arbain, Page 34, by Mirza Ghulam Qadiani)<br>
      "The Heavens and the earth are with you as they are with Me." (Anjam-e- Atham, Page 52; Tadhkira, Page 65 (2nd Edition)<br>
       
       
      The Christian God
      <br>
      Apparently, the wealth (Zakat) he had hoarded over the years and the prestige of being compared with all the Prophets(pbuh) had blinded Mirza to authentic Islamic teachings. His disbelief grew even more, as shown in the following passages of his later writings:
      <br>
      "Prophet Daniel has termed me as Michael, in his book; and in Hebrew, Michael literally means, 'one like God'". (Arbain, No. 3, Page 25, By Mirza Ghulam Qadiani) (Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 17, Page 413)
       
      <br>
      God Like
      <br>
      May Allah(SWT) have mercy on us for reproducing these authentic writings of Mirza Ghulam Qadiani. We allow his own writings, alleged to be divine revelation, speak for itself:
      Here are some of his Writings !<br>
      
      "I am given the power to cause death and to give life from the Lord, the all- Powerful." (Khutba Ilhamia, Page 55-56)
      "Oh Ahmad, your name will be completed but My name will not be completed." (Anjam-e-Atham, Page 52; Tadhkira, Page 51)
      "Allah praises you in the heavens. He praises you and comes unto you." (Anjam-e-Atham, Page 55-56; Tadhkira, Page 276 (2nd Edition))
      <br>
      "You are unto me as my Oneness and my Soleness." (Anjam-e-Atham, Page 51; Tadhkira, Page 66, 304)
      "I dreamt that I was Allah and I believed that I was really he." (Aina-i-Kamalat, Page 564)
      "God stands where you (Mirza Ghulam) stand." (Al-Bushra, Vol 2, Page 24)
      "I saw that I was God, and believed that I was He, and in that condition I was saying, 'We intend to create a new system and a new heaven and earth.' Then, I said 'We decorated the Lower heaven with Lights; and added, We shall create men out of the extract of earth'." (Kitab-ul-Bariya, Page 78; Aina-i-Kamalat, Page 564)

      <h1>Manners of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani</h1><hr>
      <p>Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani did not have any scruples at using profanities to try to ridicule, intimidate, or threaten people who did not accept his false claim to prophethood. Here are a few examples of his writings:

        "My enemies are dirty swine and their women are more wretched than bitches."
        (Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 14, P. 53; Najmul Huda, P. 10, 53)
        
        "All Muslims regard my books with reverence and care and benefit from their sublime thoughts except those who are the offspring of prostitutes (bastards); God has put a seal upon their hearts and they do not accept me." (Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 5, Page 547-548; Mirat-o-Kamalat-i-Islam, P. 547;
        Aeena-e-Kamalat Islam, P.547-548)
        [Mirza Ghulam translated this Arabic word as "Bastard" in Roohany Khazaen Vol. 11, P.282)
        
        "The one who has no belief in our ultimate victory is fond of becoming bastard and he is bound to be product of fornication." (Roohany Kazaen, Vol. 9, P. 31; Anwar ul Islam, P. 30)
        
        "If Abdullah Athum is saved from death (as per Mirza's prophecy) and if all the world say the Christian was correct, then the bastard will not follow the right path." (Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 9, P. 32)
        
        "Abdul Haq is not content with our victories. He is itching to become a bastard." (Anwar-ul-Islam, P. 30)
        
        "There is nothing more foul than a pig in the world. But the ulema who oppose me are more foul than pigs." (Anjam-i-Atham, P. 21)
        
        
        The puzzling thing is that he himself wrote:
        "I have never abused anyone." (Moahiburahman, P. 18)
        
        "He is worst who is abusive, his heart is as filthy as Latrine." (Sar-e-Sumain, P. 74)
        
        "Abuses and rebukes are not the acts of a believer and a believer can not be a curser." (Azalat-ul-Auham, P. 66)
        
        Mirza Ghulam's Knowledge and Practice of Islam
        The family and close associates of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani have recorded a great deal on this subject. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani appears not to have been particularly bright or attentive all his life. Additionally, by the time he claimed to have received revelations to be Mahdi and Messiah (about 1891), he had suffered from severely weakened mental faculties. Let us review some of the evidence attesting to these facts.
        
        "Mia Abdullah Sinnori narrated to me that once Hazrat Saheb (Mirza Ghulam) was given a gift of a pocket watch. Hazrat Saheb wrapped the watch in a handkerchief and put it in his pocket; he did not use the chain (to hang it from his vest). When he wanted to tell the time, he used to take the watch out (unwrap it) and count aloud starting from one, while pointing to each digit by finger (counting clockwise). He was unable to tell time by just looking at the watch. (Seerat-ul-Mahdi, Vol. 1, P. 180); by Mirza Bashir Ahmad)
        
        "Once someone brought for him (Mirza) gurgabi (a kind of shoes used in Punjab). He put them on, but could not distinguish between the right and the left shoe. Often, he used to wear them on the wrong foot, and then feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, feeling pain after walking in the wrong shoe, he used to get irritated and say that nothing of those people was good. Mother said that she had marked the right and left shoes for his convenience and yet he used to put the shoes on the wrong foot. Hence, she took the markings off." (Seerat-ul-Mahdi, Vol. 1, P. 67); by Mirza Bashir Ahmad)
        
        "His holiness, the Promised Messiah, suffered from hypochondria on account of weakness of the brain." (Published in Review of Religion, August 1926)
        
        
        Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani himself Wrote:
        
        "I have a very bad memory. I meet a person many times, but after sometimes I forget that I ever met him. This condition has reached a stage beyond description." (Maktoobat-e-Ahmadiyya, Vol. 5, No. 3)
        
        
        "I do not consider you have reached the state of weakness of brain that I have reached." (Makatoob-e-Ahmadiyya, Vol. 5, No. 13; written in a letter to Hakim Nuruddin in 1891)
        
        No Hajj, No Zakat, No Etikaf, No Tasbih for Mirza Mirza Ghulam was indeed a strange claimant to Prophethood and sainthood. How could he have made such outlandish claims, when he did not even faithfully fulfill the pillars of Islam. Let's review what his own son has written:
        "Doctor Mir Muhammad Ismail Saheb narrated to me that hazrat Promised Messiah never performed Hajj, never gave Zakat, never sat in Etikaf (extra worship during the last 10 nights of the month of Ramadhan), never kept a Tasbih and in my presence he refused to eat tropical sand lizard. This humble self submits he probably sat in Etikaf before his commissioning. Later on, he did not do Etikaf because of the pen crusades he waged and other engagements... And he did not give Zakat because it never accrued to him." (Seerat-ul-Mahdi, Vol. 3, P. 119; by Mirza Bashir Ahmad)
        
        Yet, the Holy Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions never shrunk from engaging in Etikaf and Tasbih and took every opportunity to help the needy. Mirza Bashir Ahmad tried to provide an excuse to discount his father's reluctance to give Zakat. Yet, historical records show that Mirza Ghulam was living a life of comfort and had claimed to have owned 300,000 rupees (would be equivalent to millions of dollars by today's standards) he also owned some rental property which his uncle was managing. Mirza Ghulam himself admitted to this fact:
        "I have more than three hundred thousand rupees." (Haqiqat-ul-Wahy, Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 22, P. 220-221; Haqiqat-ul-Wahy, P. 211-212) [Read: Mirza Ghulam Qadiani: From Rags to Riches ] Still, he never paid Zakat! Furthermore, the Mirza of Qadian did not feel that performing Hajj was a primary duty of a claimant to Prophethood. The reason he provided for his unwillingness to undertake the demanding and arduous (by the standard of the 19th century) journey to Makkah is indeed very weak.
        
        "A letter from Moulvi Muhammad Hussain Batalvi was read out in the presence of hazrat Promised Messiah in which he had objected: 'Why do you not perform Hajj?' In reply, hazrat Promised Messiah said: 'My First priority is to kill swine and break the Cross. At the moment, I am killing swine - many of them have died but some hard souls are still alive. Let me be free from this first'." (Malfoozat-e-Ahmadiya, Vol. 5, P. 264; by Manzoor Ilahi Qadiani) Mirza neither succeeded in his attempt to "kill the swine and break the Cross", nor did he perform Hajj. After his death, his followers tried to justify this shortcoming with the following statements:
        
        "This humble self submits, there were of course some special reasons for not performing Hajj. In the beginning, there was no financial arrangement for him because all properties were, from the outset, in the hands of our grandfather and later on my elder uncle managed them. After that, such circumstances arose that on the one hand he (Mirza) remained preoccupied with Jihad (author: abolishing it!) and secondly, the passage to Hajj was dangerous. However, he did desire to perform Hajj." (Seerat-ul-Mahdi, Vol. 3, P. 119; by Mirza Bashir Ahmad)
        
        "Hajj did not become obligatory on Hazrat Saheb because of his poor health. He always remained ill. Also, the Ruler of Hejaz was against him because the Muslims of India had obtained a Shariat Decree (a Fatwa) from Makkah for his (Mirza's) execution. Therefore, the government of Hejaz had turned against him." (Al-Fadl, Sept. 10, 1929) In our opinion, it was divine prudence which deprived Mirza from performing Hajj, since one of the signs of Mahdi and Messiah is that they will perform Hajj in the holy city of Makkah.
        Nightly Massages by Unrelated Women is a Blessing Mirza Ghulam enjoyed having unrelated women serve him in seclusion, during the night hours. Although many of his own followers objected to this practice, this habit went on up to his dying days. We provide here a few references:
        "My late wife went to Hazrat Promised Messiah at the age of fifteen in Dar-ul-Aman (Mirza's room).The Sire very much liked her service of massage his legs." (Al-Fadl, March 20, 1928, P. 6-7; by Ghulam Muhammad Qadiani)
        
        "Question No. 6: (from Muhammad Hussain Saheb Qadiani) Why does the pious Hazrat (Mirza) get his legs and arms massaged by unrelated stranger women? Answer: (from Hakim Fazal Din Qadiani) He is an innocent Prophet and caress with him is not prohibited; it is rather a source of suspiciousness and blessing'." (Al-Hakm, April 17, 1907, P. 13) Unknowingly, his own son rejected this practice of Mirza Ghulam as being contrary to the Shariat of Islam and not befitting a claimant to sainthood:
        
        "This humble self submits that the Holy Prophet (ﷺ) , as per Hadith, did not touch the womenfolk at the time of Baiat. The Holy Quran states that a woman should not display her embellishments to a stranger or unrelated person. This prohibition includes touching by hand, because womanly embellishment can be known by coming into contact with the body." (Seerat-ul-Mahdi, Vol. 3, P. 15; by Mirza Bashir Ahmad)</p><br>
        <h1>Qadiani (Ahmadi) abuse Kalimah</h1><hr>
        <p>These are the words (Kalimah) by which one declares his/her intention to become a Muslim. A person, who understands and repeats this phrase in sincerity and devotion, lives and acts in accordance to its meaning and fulfills its requirement, belongs to the Muslim Ummah. [Read: The Significance of Shahada (Kalimah)]
 
          Qadiani Ahmadi) leaders and missionaries, quite astutely, claim that since they also utter the same words (Kalimah), they should be considered Muslims! Is this something we should be concerned about or is it simply another attempt on their part to mislead the uninformed?
           
          In Al Quran - Surah we are told:
           
          O you who believe! When you go abroad in the cause of Allah, investigate carefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were you yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that you do. (Al Quran - Surah An-Nisa 4 : Ayah 94)
           
          Indeed, we are required to accept anyone's claim to be a Muslim, unless his own actions and statements prove that he is not a Muslim. Obviously, declaring someone or the followers of an entire doctrine Kafir should be taken very seriously. In fact, admonishing those who have astrayed far from the teachings of Islam is a serious task entrusted to our learned scholars.
           
          Finally, we like to point out that the Kalimah uttered by Qadianis Ahmadis) is meant to have a different meaning than those recited by Muslims. In support of this claim, we present the following writings of Mirza Ghulam Qadiani and his associates:
           
           
          "I am the Maseeh of the time and I am Moses on whom God conferred His speech. I am Muhammad and Ahmad, the selected one." (Taryaq-ul-Qulub, P. 3/6; Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 15, P. 134)
           
          "Muhammad is the messenger of Allah and those accompanying Him (His companions are very strict against the unbelievers). In this divine revelation, I am named Muhammad and the Prophet of Allah." (Aik Ghalti ka Izala, P. 3; Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 18, P. 207)
           
          "Muhammad has again come down among us. His position is an improvement on his earlier visitation. If any man wishes to see Muhammad, more competent, then he should see Ghulam Ahmad, in Qadian." (Al-Badr, 25 Oct. 1906)
           
          "Twenty Six years ago, God called me Muhammad and Ahmad, in Buraheen-i- Ahmadiah." (Roohany Khazaen, Vol. 22, P. 502)</p><br>
