        <h1>About  Tehreek Tahaffuze Khatme Nubuwwat </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Tehreek Tahaffuze Khatme Nubuwwat has been formed to inculcate discipline and organization of the authentic messages of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) focusing on Communal unity, Harmony, and Peace. The trust was established in 2001 with a sole intensive purpose of keeping Muslim societies away from the mischief of Qadianism and Christianity, and making them steadfast with belief in Allah and his final Messenger (ﷺ) and the seal of his Prophet hood. This goal directly aims to protect the sacred personality of the final messenger Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). It is clearly declared in the Holy Quran that no Prophet will come after Muhammad (ﷺ) and he is the last and the seal the Prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the divine facts Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani (Founder of Jamaat Ahmadiya) introduce himself as the last Prophet who is blasphemous and false. The disciples and followers of Qadianism have a mission to make the proof of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) doubtful in the eyes of uneducated and poor Muslim communities. They propagate that there was a scope of a Prophet to come, and validate the claims made by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani that he is the last prophet, and thus make innocent people renounce their faith.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fundamental aim of Majlise Tahaffuze Khatme Nubuwwat Trust is to eradicate this very evil effort and conspiracy of Qadiyani sect, protect the faith of those innocent muslims who are pulled into their falsehood of Qadiyanism and defend the seal of Prophet hood of Muhammad (ﷺ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Majlise Tahaffuze Khatme Nubuwwat Trust performs two important tasks in order to fulfill their mission. Firstly, to provide religious education in villages and to encourage Islamic preachers (Dawah & Tabligh). Secondly, to educate the urban population about the belief in the finality of Prophethood and create a general view point about the blasphemous Qadiyani Cult Practices. In order to accomplish the first task we are establishing the schools in villages with a belief that the education is the light that drives away the darkness of ignorance, and constructing of Mosques since they are among the pillars on which the Muslim faith rests. To carry out our second task we arrange our regular congregations (Jamat), train the youth, students and members of religious organizations to confront, dialogue, and debate with the Qadiyanis.
